# Intuition
The Intuition is to determine if two strings are anagrams, compare the characters in both strings and check if they have the same characters but in a different order. By tracking the count of each character, if the counts match for all characters, the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

# Approach
Hash Map
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(s+t) => O(n)

- Space complexity:
O(n)

# Code
```
class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i],0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i],0)
        return countS == countT
```
